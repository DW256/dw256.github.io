### What I Did
- Designed and implemented core gameplay and progression systems using Unity and ScriptableObject-based architectures.
- Implemented and maintained core live-service systems, including daily and weekly missions, Battle Pass progression, time-limited events, and monetization features (IAP and ads integration).
- Integrated client-side systems with third-party backend APIs, defining JSON-based data payloads and managing player data synchronization.
- Optimized backend communication by batching initial data loads, reducing API calls and improving load performance.
- Improved production stability by applying defensive coding, state validation, and structured logging to handle edge cases in live environments.
- Profiled and optimized performance-critical code paths using Unity Profiler, and managed asset lifecycles with Unity Addressables to prevent memory leaks and ensure stability during long-running sessions.

### Notes
- Live-service mobile game built with systems designed to support ongoing updates and events.
