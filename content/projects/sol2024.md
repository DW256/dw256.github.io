### What I Did

- Developed core gameplay systems during **Gameseed 2024** as part of a small, cross-functional team (*The Bois Project*).
- Collaborated using **Git-based version control**, handling feature branching and merge coordination.
- Integrated and configured **A* Pathfinding Project** for AI navigation and dynamic movement.
- Implemented **NPC logic** for multiple deployable ally types and diverse enemy behaviors.
- Built a reusable **object pooling system** to optimize runtime performance.
- Designed and implemented **spawn systems** for enemies and allies.
- Created a **deploy system** including placement validation, cooldown handling, and interaction flow.
- Implemented an in-game **dialog system** to support narrative delivery.
- Developed a **player state machine** to manage player actions and transitions consistently.
